# Traffic Sign Classifier for Self Driving Cars

Implementation through LeNet Architecture using Tensorflow.

To test it out, [download](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/5898cd6f_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip) the dataset and change file path respectively.

Try playing around with hyperparameters, or manipulating training data.

### ToDo

1. Different architectures
    - [ ] AlexNet
    - [ ] GoogLeNet
    - [ ] ZF Net
    - [ ] VGG Net
    - [ ] Microsoft ResNet
    - [ ] Generative Adversarial Networks
2. Improve
    - [ ] Add Dropout or L2 Regularization
